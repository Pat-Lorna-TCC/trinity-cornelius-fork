# Project Cornelius

**AI-powered second brain template for Claude Code + Obsidian**

Capture insights, discover connections, and synthesize knowledge - with AI assistance.

> 🌱 **Ships pre-seeded.** This isn't an empty template - it comes with a working knowledge graph of **~1,000 interlinked notes** on decision-making, judgment, and cognitive science (distilled from published research and books, ~5,000 edges). Clone it and `/advise`, `/recall`, or `/find-connections` work immediately. Start at [`Brain/03-MOCs/MOC - Knowledge Base.md`](Brain/03-MOCs/MOC%20-%20Knowledge%20Base.md), then layer your own thinking on top. See [knowledge-base-analysis.md](knowledge-base-analysis.md) for what's inside.

## What's New in v06.26

- **Seeded public knowledge base (1,031 notes)** - The template now ships with a real, fully-indexed library instead of a few showcase notes: 1,031 decision-science notes distilled from 57 research sessions and 6 books, spanning decision-making, judgment, behavioral economics, and the cognitive science beneath good decisions
- **11 new Maps of Content** - Topic-level navigation across decision-making, cognitive biases, risk and antifragility, neuroscience, consciousness, learning and memory, motivation, social cognition, embodied cognition, and meaning and wisdom
- **Portable prebuilt index** - The FAISS + graph index was rebuilt over the new corpus with vault-relative paths, so semantic search, recall, and connection discovery work on any clone immediately - no indexing required before you start exploring
- **Neutral, provenance-tagged notes** - External research distilled into atomic notes (provenance: encountered), navigated via the MOCs; only the foundation tier is published (agent-research and private tiers withheld)

<details>
<summary>v05.26 changes</summary>

- **Incubation loop** - Autonomous iterative thinking engine; each run applies a rotating analytical move (ACH, Bayesian update, steelman, cross-domain bridge, implication check) and persists reasoning state across scheduled runs
- **Domain watch** - Autonomous perception layer that scans the KB for new notes matching configured domains, checks gap resonance, and probes external signals to auto-activate topics for the incubation loop
- **Insight interview** - KB-grounded Socratic dialogue; searches existing notes on a topic then runs a one-question-at-a-time session to surface and sharpen your thinking, saving results as permanent notes
- **YouTube transcript** - Extract transcripts from any YouTube video for processing into the knowledge base
- **deep-research Phase 4** - Optional insight interview step before connection discovery, capturing your personal angles alongside extracted research
- **45 skills** for insight capture, autonomous thinking, connection discovery, research, and content creation
</details>

<details>
<summary>v04.26 changes</summary>

- **Brain Dependency Graph (BDG)** - Directed, mode-aware dependency graph layered on Local Brain Search. Seven semantic layers (signal -> synthesis), staleness propagation, lifecycle tracking, and tension detection
- **Staleness propagation** - `/propagate-change` traces which downstream notes need review when a framework changes
- **Lifecycle scoring** - `/compute-lifecycle` detects reflective -> crystallizing -> generative transitions
- **Tension detection** - `/detect-tensions` finds productive contradictions (high similarity + opposing conclusions)
- **Coherence sweeps** - `/coherence-sweep` runs full structural health analysis with staleness and lifecycle reports
- **Brain merge** - `/brain-merge` compares and selectively merges Brain directories across agent instances
- **Explanatory images** - `/create-explanatory-image` generates AI diagrams via Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- **LBS daemon** - Background search daemon for persistent vector search
- **36 skills** for insight capture, connection discovery, research, and content creation
- **10 specialized sub-agents** for different knowledge tasks
</details>

<details>
<summary>v03.26 changes</summary>

- **SYNAPSE-inspired memory** - Spreading activation search with intent classification and usage-based learning
- **Dialectic engine** - Two sub-agents argue committed positions while orchestrator synthesizes
- **Autonomous research** - `/learn-new-things` runs full research cycles with git branching
- **Insight graduation** - `/graduate-insights` promotes draft notes to permanent status with Zettelkasten criteria
- **Q-value learning** - Search rankings improve over time based on actual usage patterns
- **Trinity-compatible** - Can be deployed to the Trinity agent orchestration platform
</details>

## Recommended: Deploy to Trinity for Autonomous Operation

Running locally is fine for development. For persistent autonomous operation - scheduled research, incubation loops, domain watching, and agent collaboration - deploy Cornelius to **[Trinity](https://github.com/Abilityai/trinity)**.

Trinity is an open-source platform for self-hosting autonomous agent fleets. Each agent runs in an isolated Docker container with cron scheduling, real-time monitoring, and agent-to-agent delegation.

On Trinity, Cornelius also gets the **Brain Orb** - a live 3D visualization of this knowledge base on the agent's Brain tab, with scope mounting (per-book sub-scopes included), voice-drivable KB search, and capture/link/refresh actions that write back into the vault. The seeded KB renders out of the box (`data.seed.json`); the hook contract ships in `.trinity/brain-orb/` (requires a Trinity base image from 2026-07 or later, with the platform's Brain Orb flags enabled).

**Fastest path:** Use the `trinity` plugin from the [Abilities marketplace](https://github.com/Abilityai/abilities):

```bash
# Install the plugin
claude plugin add abilityai/abilities

# Then from inside Cornelius:
/trinity:connect    # one-time auth
/trinity:onboard    # deploy
```

### Sample Vault (`Brain/`)

Complete Zettelkasten structure with templates:

```
Brain/
├── 00-Inbox/              # Quick capture, unprocessed notes
├── 01-Sources/            # Literature notes, references
├── 02-Permanent/          # Atomic, evergreen notes (CORE)
├── 03-MOCs/               # Maps of Content
├── 04-Output/             # Articles, frameworks, insights
│   └── Articles/          # Each article in own folder
├── 05-Meta/               # System notes, changelogs
├── AI Extracted Notes/    # AI-extracted from YOUR content
└── Document Insights/     # AI-extracted from external content
```

### Local Brain Search (`resources/local-brain-search/`)

FAISS-powered vector search with SYNAPSE-inspired memory architecture:

```bash
# Semantic search (static mode - fast)
./run_search.sh "dopamine motivation" --limit 10 --json

# Spreading activation search (better for synthesis queries)
./run_search.sh "how does dopamine relate to decision making" --mode spreading --json

# Find connections
./run_connections.sh "Note Name" --json

# Graph analytics
./run_connections.sh --hubs --json    # Most connected notes
./run_connections.sh --bridges --json  # Cross-domain connectors
./run_connections.sh --stats --json    # Graph statistics

# Learning system status
./run_learning.sh status              # Q-value stats
./run_learning.sh top                 # Top notes by learned relevance

# Re-index after changes
./run_index.sh
```

**Memory Architecture:**
- **Intent Classification** - Routes queries as factual/conceptual/synthesis/temporal
- **Spreading Activation** - Propagates relevance through graph with lateral inhibition
- **Usage-Based Learning** - Q-values adjust rankings based on what you actually use
- **Configuration** - Single source of truth in `memory_config.py`

### Brain Dependency Graph (`resources/brain-graph/`)

A directed, mode-aware dependency graph layered on top of Local Brain Search. Every relationship has **direction** (who's authoritative), **mode** (generative vs reflective), and **type** (derives-from, instantiates, references, associates, tension, supersedes).

**Seven Semantic Layers:** signal (1) -> impression (2) -> insight (3) -> framework (4) -> lens (5) -> synthesis (6) -> index (7)

```bash
# Bootstrap the graph from your vault
./run_brain_graph.sh bootstrap

# Check graph status
./run_brain_graph.sh status --json

# Inspect a specific note's dependencies
./run_brain_graph.sh inspect "Note Name" --json

# Propagate staleness from a changed note
./run_brain_graph.sh propagate "Note Name" --json

# Compute lifecycle scores (reflective -> crystallizing -> generative)
./run_brain_graph.sh lifecycle --json

# Find productive contradictions
./run_brain_graph.sh tensions --json

# Full coherence report
./run_brain_graph.sh coherence --days 7 --tensions --json
```

**Key Behaviors:**
- When a framework note changes, staleness propagates downstream with attenuation
- Notes transition from reflective -> crystallizing -> generative based on citation patterns
- Productive contradictions (tension edges) are immune to staleness - surfaced as synthesis opportunities
- Authority is edge-local, not node-global

**Architecture details:** See `resources/brain-graph/BRAIN-DEPENDENCY-GRAPH-ARCHITECTURE.md`
